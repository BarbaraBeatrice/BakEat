## General Information
I created this app in order to understand how a single project can be adapted to many devices: you will see that some platforms present different features.
It's a simple app that collects recipes and it presents various features depending on the device: besides the navigation (Sidebar for macOS and iPad and Tabview for the rest), I also designed different uses of the same app.
The Apple Watch version is, in fact, conceived as a companion app for the iPhone, that should show the ingredients and the procedure for a recipe only after it has been selected from the mobile version.
For the Apple TV version I thought that the best format to render a recipe in an engaging way (while also taking advantage of the immersive technology that this device offers) would be video-recipes.
